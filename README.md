# C. Elegans 3000

## Paradigm

+ User can create new models of cells and neurons using the classes in `Cells.py` (heritage)
+ The class `neural_network` from `Neural_network.py` takes as an input a connectome model and builds a net of interconnected cells
+ The class neural_network_server from `Neural_network.py` creates a socket and wait for signals to be processed by the neural network

## Parameter setting

+ Create your parameters file `parameters/params.py` to the parameters folder as in the `params.py` file

## Observations

+ The classes CElegans3000, CElegans3000-client and CElegans3000-server will be deleted soon
